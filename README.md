WeatherGround is a tweak that brings weather to your fingertips!

WeatherGround offers 3 (+ bonus) features currently:

- Live weather background as wallpaper!
- Live weather effects on top of your current wallpaper
- Tapping on the time in status bar to see the current temperature!
- (BONUS) If you have 2 different wallpapers, you can enable/disable the background or effect for the homescreen and lockscreen separately

**The tweak only fully works on iPhones (X device recommended), iPads do not support the wallpaper features**
**Supports iOS 13.0 to 14.6**


Credits to @NSExceptional for the wallpaper idea and the info needed to make that feature possible.
